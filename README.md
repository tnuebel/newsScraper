The news scraper app searches the NY Times website for headlines, article summary and the article URL as well.  Each scraped article will be saved to the app database, and the app can scrape and display the mentioned information for each article.

Users will be able to leave comments on the articles they viewed, and the database will save the comments so the user can visit at a later date.  Users will be able to delete their comments, as well.  All stored comments will be visible by all users.
